This project started as a side project during a summer vacation but so many years later it continues to be a great joy to be able to see it being used by so many people around the world. This project was possible by the great support from SOE/DBG/RPG to their playerbase. Also a great thanks to my comrades at [D3RP Company](https://www.derpcompany.com/), whose support and cheer always made me come back to this game. There is also an innumerable amount of players that have helped me with feedback, donations and translations, to all of you, thanks you for your support. I hope that Auraxis Control Center continues to be your application of choice!
