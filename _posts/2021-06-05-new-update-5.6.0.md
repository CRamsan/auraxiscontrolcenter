The day has finally arrived and the almost full-rewrite of Auraxis Control Center is finally out on the PlayStore. This is version 5.6.0 which brings a needed refresh to the UI alopngside with an almost complete rewrite of the internals.
The most notable change for users will be the UI but my personal goal with this update was to clean up the code to make future development much easier. That is the reason why it took this long to get this update out but I feel that this goal was achieved.

One of the feattures that was dropped was the tablet UI. Tablet users will have a strecheted out phone UI for the moment until I can implement this feature again.
