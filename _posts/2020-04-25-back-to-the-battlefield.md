Hello Auraxians, it sure has been a while since I have updated this application. To be honest, life just got busy over the years and I had to stop playing Planetside. But ever since the new [Escalation](https://www.planetside2.com/news/ps2-escalation-update-launch-february-2020) update, I have been back and giving this game some regular play again. It has been fun seen the game continue to grow over the years and also seen some old faces still around.

With that out of the way, it is time to give this tool some love again. I have done several changes under the hood, as result you should see less crashes. Most of the changes were to update the code base to make it easy to maintain in the future. As of right now I do not have any clear new features to come so I am open to feedback. In the following weeks I will be getting myself familiar with the new APIs for the recent Planetside changes and I should have some updates with things to come after that.

If you haver any question or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at [contact@cramsan.com](mailto:contact@cramsan.com). See you all in the battlefield,
