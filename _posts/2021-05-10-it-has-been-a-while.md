It has been more than a year since the last update. Not really what I had in mind for 2020 but I dont think anyone was really sure how 2020 was going to turn up. 

But development in the app did not stop. Instead I put a lot of work to refactor most of the internals of the app. The main achievements are:
- Completely reworked most of the app internals. Focusing on following best-practices to ensure better long-term sustainability.
- Most of the code is now cross-platform.
- Reworked UI to use new Compose framework.

When all the work is complete, the app will look slightly better but most functionality will be the same as before. Now the goal is to have the new update out by the end of May.
