Since the big release of 5.6.0, development has slowed down a bit. There has been some small bug fix releases but nothing mayor. At the moment I feel pretty happy with the state of the app and I am looking for ways to expand on it outside of the Android app itself.

Some of the things I have been playing with lately has been maybe making a companion Planetside2 Discord bot or maybe a companion iOS or Web app. I have been putting time on working on the tech that would power all these possibilities and I have some tech demos, but not concrete direction just yet.

That was all I had to say for this quick update. If you haver any question or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at [contact@cramsan.com](mailto:contact@cramsan.com). See you all in the battlefield,
